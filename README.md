## Implementations

[Vanilla GAN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2661) by Ian Goodfellow et al.(GAN implemented using linear layers and non-linearities, trained on MNIST to generate realistic looking images of hand-written digits)

[DCGAN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06434) by Radford et al. (GAN implemented using CNNs, trained on CelebA to generate images which look similar to the training data)
