# GNR652 Project
Implementation of various Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs):\n
-- Vanilla GAN (GAN implemented using linear layers and non-linearities, trained on MNIST to generate realistic looking images of hand-written digits)\n
-- DCGAN (GAN implemented using CNNs, trained on CelebA to generate images which look similar to the training data) 
-- Implementation of Globally and Locally Consistent Image Completion Networks for image impainting tasks
